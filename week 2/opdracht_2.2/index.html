	<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
	<p>
		Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page.<br>
		It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of<br> 
		the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.
	</p>
	<h1>What are HTML-Elements?</h1>
	<p>
		Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to bedisplayed.
	</p>
	<h1>What is a tag?</h1>
	<p>
		An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will<br>
		be displayed per the instructions of the element.
	</p>
	<h1>
		How does the browser use HTML to create what Isee?
	</h1>
	<p>
		The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended<br>
		the data to appear on the screen.
	</p>
	<h1>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</h1>
	<p>
		The elements we learned about were html, head, body, ‘p’, span, div, and h1-h6
	</p>
	<h1>More Elements</h1>
	<h2>A-tag</h2>
	<p>
		The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other<br>
		areas within our own web page). You will always see the ‘a’ element used with<br>
		the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.
	</p>
	<p><img src="image1.png"></p>
	<h2>Img-tag</h2>
	<p>
		This element will display an image on the screen.<br>
		It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which points to the address of the image to be displayed.<br>
		NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in they do not need two tags.<br>
		Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:
